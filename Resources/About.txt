The 'pattonium.net' personal website was built as a means of promoting myself and my projects, and is currently not intended for commercial use.

Here, you can use the command line interface to find useful content that I think you'll enjoy! I won't be posting very often, but I'm going to try to make every piece of content worth your time. Thanks for visiting!
